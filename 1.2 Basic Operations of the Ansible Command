Step 1 Ansible uses the ping module to check whether the communication with the
controlled hosts is normal.
Run the following command to invoke the ping module and check whether the controller
can communicate with the controlled hosts:
ansible all -m ping

The command output contains warning information. You can add interpreter_python =
auto_legacy_silent to [default] in the configuration file to clear the warning.


Step 2 Practice the Ansible -k option.
Use the -k option to enter the SSH password in interactive mode. The method is as
follows:
ansible all -k -m ping

Step 3 Use the host tag to execute tasks.
all indicates all hosts in the host list. Use the host tag to specify the host that runs the
command. The command is as follows:
ansible Nginx -m ping


⚫ Task: Check the communication status between the host in the Zabbix group and the
controller.



Step 4 Use --list-host to list the corresponding hosts.
--list-host can be abbreviated as --list, as shown in the following figure:

ansible Nginx --list

Step 5 Logical relationship of Ansible.
Run the following command to check the communication between the Zabbix or Nginx
host group and the controller.
ansible "Zabbix:Nginx" -m ping

Run the following command to check the communication between the shared hosts in
the Zabbix and Nginx host groups and the controller:
ansible "Zabbix:&Nginx" -m ping


⚫ Question: Why are there no matched hosts?
Answer: The preceding information is displayed because the two host groups do not have
shared hosts.
Run the following command to check the communication between the controller and the
hosts that do not belong to the Nginx host group:
ansible ': !Nginx' -m ping



Step 6 Check the Ansible execution process.
Use the -v parameter to check the Ansible command execution process, as shown in the
following figure:
ansible ':!Nginx' -v -m ping

⚫ Task: Run -vv and -vvv to check more detailed execution process.
